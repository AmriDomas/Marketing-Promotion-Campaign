# Marketing Promotion Campaign - Machine Learning Ensemble (Voting & Stacking) 🚀
This project applies Voting and Stacking Ensemble Machine Learning to predict customer conversion in a marketing promotion campaign. The dataset contains customer behavior features, such as recency, purchase history, discount usage, and promotional channels.

The model leverages Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Random Forest as base learners, with Logistic Regression as the meta-learner in a Stacking Classifier. Additionally, Voting Classifier is used to enhance performance through model averaging.

Key Features

✅ Data preprocessing, encoding categorical variables

✅ Model training with Voting & Stacking Ensemble

✅ Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
